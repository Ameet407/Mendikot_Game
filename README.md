## About the Game

Mendikot is a traditional trick-taking card game for 4 players divided into two teams. The game involves strategy, skill, and a bit of luck. The main goal is to collect "tens" (cards with a value of 10) and winning tricks to score points.

### Key Game Features:

- Team formation via drawing cards
- 13 trick-based gameplay with a trump suit
- Special winning conditions like Mendikot (collecting all 4 tens)
- Dealer rotation mechanics
- Traditional scoring system

### Winning Conditions:

The winning team is determined in this order:
1. **Mendikot**: A team that collects all 4 tens wins automatically
2. **Whitewash**: A team that wins all 13 tricks gets a perfect score
3. **3 Tens**: A team that collects 3 tens wins the deal
4. **Tiebreaker**: If both teams collect 2 tens each, the team with 7 or more tricks wins
5. **Most Tens**: Otherwise, the team with more tens wins the deal
